## 🔧 How to Use

### Option 1: Without OpenAI (Default)
**No configuration needed!**
- The system works perfectly with intelligent keyword-based responses
- Understands gift shop queries
- Provides helpful recommendations
- **Just works out of the box** ✨

### Option 2: With OpenAI (Enhanced)
**For even more intelligent responses:**

1. Get an API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

2. Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:
```bash
cd server
nano .env
```

3. Add your API key:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=500
```

4. Restart docker-compose:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

The system will automatically use GPT-4 when available, or fallback to keyword-based responses.
